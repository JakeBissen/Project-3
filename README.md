  Hello! My Name is Jake Bissen. The project/website you are seeing is my attempt at making a simple task organizer. The simple goal is to input the description of a todo/tasks. Upon adding said todo, it will  e added to a list of other todos that are named with a brief description of the task. I provided some filler todos to provide an example. 
  To simply use this, just navagate to the "todos" link. Fill out the form with a name, a brief descripton, and a date. The todo will be added to the list section. There you can edit it, mark it as finished, or even delete it. 
  Ultimately, this is meant to mimic a task organizer that will be seen within companys. I also provided a form that acts as company support. To aid me in this project, I used CSS, HTML, Javascript, React with vite, and TypeScript. While it is simple, there are plently of things that I could add on to it. For instance, I can add a better date system that would allow you to sort by either oldest or newest added. I could also fix up the container boxes so that they are even with one another, as well as possibly add timers to time how long a task might take for company evaluation.
